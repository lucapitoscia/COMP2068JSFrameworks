Hello,

I went with a basic clean and modern design for my portfolio because i plan on adding actual projects to a website to add to my resume after i graduate
for the simplicity of the assignment i just used some school projects and assignments that i had on github. By third party im not sure if you mean things
like google fonts or bootstrap css but i used that in my assignment to customize my site.
